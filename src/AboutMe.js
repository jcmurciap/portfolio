            <p>Hello there! My name is Juan Camilo. I'm FrontEnd and Industrial enginner.
                Before now, I worked at Rappi and Sport Life like technology analyst, and 
                graduated (in progress) from ECCI University. I currently make a lot of 
                mini-projects and putting on ideas to get more confident about software 
                development specially to frontEnd side, however I also do things on the 
                server side like a <em>CRUD</em> using <em>MERN</em> stack.<br/>
                <br/><em>I'm self though developer</em> because that the moment when I discovered programming
                language I fell 
                in love with it and I will not change my mind for at least the next 80 years.
                 I think that I could be a key piece in your organization because I really 
                like real challenges, I learn quickly and I like to work as a team.
            </p>
        </div>
